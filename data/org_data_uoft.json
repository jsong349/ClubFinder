The infant radio station grew steadily, building important associations with CJRT-FM and CHUM-FM. By the early 1970s it was clear that Radio University -- now Input Radio -- was reaching and representing an increasingly diverse audience. Throughout the 1970's and 80's, the station maintained its commitment to pursuing the issues and stories ignored by most mainstream news outlets. By doing so Input Radio and its successor CJUT developed a loyal audience in Toronto. The next obvious step was to increase the station's broadcast range by becoming an FM station. This was accomplished in 1986, and CJUT became CIUT-FM. While continuing to reach both University of Toronto students and the broader Toronto community, the station also found new audiences all across Central and Southern Ontario. Now, thanks to Star Choice's National Satellite Network and Webcasting through Virtuecast, CIUT-FM is bringing its unique brand of eclectic broadcasting to a global audience.\nAt CIUT FM we feel we've earned the right to call ourselves Real Radio. Every day volunteers and donors keep us broadcasting the news, music and information that you won't hear on commercial radio stations. It's an accomplishment we're proud of, and we need you to help us keep it happening. Your time and your donations make sure that CIUT will always be fresh, never canned. So, if community radio matters to you, please, help us keep it real.

It creates hunger beside plenty, it threatens our sustenance through unsafe and unsustainable farming, and kills the earth itself with pollution and unsustainable extraction of oil, minerals, animals, trees, and water. Capitalism leads to imperialism and war. Saving ourselves and the planet depends on finding an alternative.\nA system that is killing the planet\nCapitalist profits depend on extracting the world's blood and bone. The devastating impact of capital's assault on the planet affect the world's most vulnerable populations and threaten the long-term meaningful existence of humanity. Capitalism cannot regulate the catastrophic effects of climate change. We stand for climate justice, including the concept of \u201cjust transition\u201d for affected workers.\nSocialism and workers\u2019 power\nAny alternative to capitalism must involve replacing the system from the bottom up through radical collective action. Central to that struggle is the workplace, where capitalism reaps its profits off our backs.\nCapitalist monopolies control the earth\u2019s resources, but workers everywhere actually create the wealth. A new socialist society can only be constructed when workers collectively seize control of that wealth and plan its production and distribution to satisfy human needs, not corporate profits\u2014to respect the environment, not pollute and destroy it.\nOppression\nWithin capitalist society different groups suffer from specific forms of oppression. Attacks on oppressed groups are used to divide workers and weaken solidarity. We oppose racism and imperialism. We oppose all immigration controls. We support the right of people of colour and other oppressed groups to organize in their own defence. We are for real, social, economic and political equality for women. We are for an end to all forms of discrimination and homophobia against lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgendered people.\nWe oppose environmental racism. We oppose discrimination on the basis of religion, ability and age.\nCanada, Quebec, Indigenous Peoples\nCanada is not a \u201ccolony\u201d of the United States, but an imperialist country in its own right that participates in the exploitation of much of the world. The Canadian state was founded through the repression of Indigenous peoples and the people of Quebec.\nWe support the struggles for self-determination of Quebec and Indigenous peoples up to and including the right to independence. In particular, we recognize Indigenous peoples' original and primary right to decide their fate and that of their lands, heritage, and traditions. Socialists in Quebec, and in all oppressed nations, work to give the struggle against national oppression an internationalist and working class content.\nInternationalism\nThe struggle for socialism is part of a worldwide struggle. We campaign for solidarity with workers in other countries. We oppose everything that turns workers from one country against those from other countries. We support all genuine national liberation movements.\nThe 1917 revolution in Russia was an inspiration for the oppressed everywhere. But it was defeated when workers\u2019 revolutions elsewhere were defeated. A Stalinist counter-revolution, which killed millions, created a new form of capitalist exploitation based on state ownership and control. In Eastern Europe, China and other countries, a similar system was later established by Stalinist, not socialist, parties. We support the struggle of workers in these countries against both private and state capitalism.\nElections and democracy\nElections can be an opportunity to give voice to the struggle for social change. But under capitalism, they can\u2019t change the system. The structures of the present parliament, army, police and judiciary protect the ruling class against the workers. These structures cannot be simply taken over and used by the working class. The working class needs real democracy, and that requires an entirely different kind of state\u2014a workers\u2019 state based upon councils of workers\u2019 delegates.\nReform and revolution\nEvery day, there are battles between exploiter and exploited, oppressor and oppressed, to reform the system\u2014to improve living conditions. These struggles are crucial in the fight for a new world. To further these struggles, we work within the trade unions and orient to building a rank and file movement that strengthens workers\u2019 unity and solidarity.\nBut the fight for reforms will not, in itself, bring about fundamental social change. The present system cannot be fixed or reformed as the NDP and many trade union leaders say. Nor can the system regulate itself to prevent environmental destruction and climate injustice. It has to be overthrown. That will require the mass action of workers themselves.\nThe revolutionary party\nTo achieve socialism the leading activists in the working class have to be organized into a revolutionary socialist party. The party must be a party of action, and it must be democratic. We are an organization of activists committed to helping in the construction of such a party through ongoing activity in the mass organizations of the working class and in the daily struggles of workers and the oppressed.\nIf these ideas make sense to you, help us in this project, and join the International Socialists.", "International Vision Canada  (IVC)": "International Students make up more than 22% of the University of Toronto\u2019s undergraduate population but there aren\u2019t enough groups to help these students navigate through the challenges of studying abroad.
