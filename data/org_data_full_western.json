This was the first such concession on an HIV/AIDS drug; price cuts on other medications soon followed. This enabled a major scale-up of HIV treatment throughout the continent. The campaign showed those students that, as major contributors to drug development, universities are well positioned to influence the way medical technologies are developed and distributed, and thus can do much to help alleviate the access-to-medicines crisis.What started as a small group of students at Yale University has now turned into a movement of more than 100 groups at universities in 18 countries around the globe, with strong coordination in Europe and Brazil and new chapters developing in India, Nepal and Tunisia, among other places.As a non-profit organization rooted in a global movement of university students, UAEM aims to(1) promote access to medicines and medical innovations in low- and middle-income countries by changing norms and practices around academic patenting and licensing, supported by our own independent research,(2) ensure that university medical research meets the needs of people worldwide and(3) empower students to respond to the access and innovation crisis.As committed students from all over the world who passionately believe in social justice and health equity, we find it unacceptable that millions of people do not have access to essential medicines. We are particularly concerned about people in developing countries who are disproportionately affected by the access to medicines crisis.Universities have a social compact with society and, as educational and research institutions, they have a responsibility to promote and manage the deployment of innovations for the public benefit. In no field are the moral imperatives to do so as clear as they are in medicine.Students are uniquely positioned to push for normative change in their universities and research institutions.

MOTIVATION: Artificial intelligence is one of the fastest growing technologies because of its seemingly endless range of possible applications, such as predicting the stock markets or controlling self-driving cars. Due to the rate at which the technology is being developed and adopted, businesses are investing more and more into searching for young talent at the undergraduate level. WAID offers Western students the opportunity to develop applicable skills and establish a foundation from which to launch careers in artificial intelligence. STRATEGY: The primary goal of WAID is to provide an opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in artificial intelligence through education and project development. Since artificial intelligence is a broad field with several subdivisions, the club will initially focus on machine learning, due to its widespread popularity, and aim to expand into other subdivisions in the future. WAID intends to support members by hosting educationals and providing resources for ongoing individual learning throughout the year. Members who apply and are selected to form project teams will be mentored by caring and compassionate project managers who will help to ensure projects remain on track. These activities will allow students with no prior machine learning experience to learn and contribute to the team projects.

We aim to promote the development and advocacy of issues surrounding transit, infrastructure and mobility in general through exciting activities, debates and discussion in our community. Issues surrounding transit and mobility have and will continue to be a problem moving forward. Cities such as London, Ontario, for example, and other global metropolitan centres continuously struggle with the issue of NIMBYs (Not-in-my-backyard) acting as a consistent obstacle to much-needed transit development. Our goal and passion is to prepare the future leaders and decision-makers of tomorrow at Western with better skills and knowledge so they can better tackle these important issues in their communities down the road. We provide members with numerous fun and interactive opportunities to discover all aspects of transportation, including but not limited to social gatherings, games nights, talks and simulations. Most importantly, this club aims to provide transit enthusiasts across the university with an option for connecting with each other. We want to serve as a forum for discussion and the sharing of ideas related to transit because when ideas spread, minds develop and potential leaders are born. Issues surrounding transit are not boring issues that only municipal public servants care about, but an issue that almost all of us tweet our anger about every day. We hope that our members will come out realizing just how interesting and impactful issues surrounding transit are and ultimately transform their communities because of it.\u00a0In summary, we as a club promise to provide to you,\u00a01. A medium to debate, exchange ideas, network and learn about issues related to transportation with other like-minded individuals.\u00a02.
